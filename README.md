# 🤖 AI Automation Projects by Dishant Makawana

Welcome to my **AI Automation Portfolio** — a growing collection of smart bots, workflow systems, and automation scripts built using **Python**, **APIs**, and **AI logic**.  
Each project here demonstrates how small, well-designed automations can simplify complex business or trading operations.
